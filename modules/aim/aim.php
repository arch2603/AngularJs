                    <p>To create a system that streamlines business processes, minimises double handling of information, and creates a real-time database of bins and their current location/status for use throughout the system by different departments. A comprehensive scheduling function will automate the pickup of bins that are on a fixed schedule, while making it very easy to manually enter a pickup upon customer request. The system will mimic the workflow of your business and alert people when their action is required.</p>
                    <p>For office staff, the system is built for efficient searching, whether it's bringing up customer details and their transaction history, to getting a full list of bins and where they are. For drivers, the system will alert them in advance when a bin is ready for pickup, allowing them to plan their routes. With a google maps integration, the system will provide a recommended route for greater efficiency. For the bean counters, the system integrates with seamlessly with the popular accounting packages including MYOB, QuickBooks, and Xero.</p>
                    <p>Go paperless! For maximum efficiency, we recommend phone/tablet apps for mobile staff so data can be entered on the spot. No more waiting for paperwork to come in (assuming it makes it back to the office) and double-entering the details. With our system talking to other systems in the background, your customers can have invoices emailed to them automatically, with the invoice details transferring to MYOB in real time.</p>
