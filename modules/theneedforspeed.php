                    <p>Nobody likes waiting in line. Even patient people get bored or angry that something is taking longer than expected. Waiting for a website to load is no different from waiting in line for a delicious pizza. We want that pizza now, and if it takes too long we'll walk out the door and go somewhere else. Even Google thinks speed is important with load time a ranking factor in its SEO algorithm.</p>

                    <p>Put simply - in the race for people's attention span you have to be Top Gun, there's no place for second best. If your site can't "buzz the tower" of every user and visitor of your site every time, then you'll quickly crash and burn. With OnePoint as your wingman your site will always have the grunt it needs for a smooth and consistent user experience. Our servers are elastic, meaning they can automatically scale up resources and hit the afterburners when there are many people are on your site, and then throttle down when demand also goes down.</p>
