                    <p>Security is a critical part of Web Sites and Applications. By design, the web server is the only resource standing between the general public and your precious data. This fact alone makes web servers a popular target for malicious actors and ne'er do wells. To combat this, OnePoint Control agents have gathered together its security, cryptography, and risk management experts and developed "The Cone of Silence" to guard your resources without disrupting the user experience.</p>

                    <p>The Cone of Silence is a protective barrier that works on both the hardware and software level. Firstly, hardware firewalls shut off any back doors into the system. The intrusion detection system constantly monitors the site itself to see if anyone is trying to guess passwords (known as "brute force" attacks) and will automatically block them. The sensitive areas of the site are encrypted only with the latest and greatest certificates, so any information passed between the user and the site (e.g. credit card information) is safe from eavesdropping by "man in the middle‚Äù attacks or Kaos agents. The programmers writing the actual code for your site have also been trained in the best practices of authentication and authorisation to prevent nasty things like injection and cross site hacks.</p>

                    <p>The bottom line: with The Cone of Silence protecting your site, you can be confident that your data (and your user's data) is safe.</p>
