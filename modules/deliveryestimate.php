                    <p>Once a contract has been effected we estimate delivery will occur approximately 8 - 12 weeks after commencement. We will endeavor to get your project up and running as soon as possible but this allows for thorough analysis, client feedback and testing.  This may change once we have begun development however we will endeavor to flag any significant changes to the delivery time as soon as they are known to us.</p>
