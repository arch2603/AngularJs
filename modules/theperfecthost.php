                    <p>OnePoint partners with Amazon Web Services for hosting of all software solutions. AWS provides an unequalled level of security and reliability, allowing us to take advantage of their multi-billion dollar global computing infrastructure. Computing resources have guaranteed minimum 99.95% uptime and with firewalls on all resources and options for virtual private networks, you can have full confidence that your previous data is in the “Cone of Silence” safe from malicious activity and those pesky Kaos Agents.</p>

                    <p>For an online business it is crucial that the public websites are available without interruption. To maintain an extremely high availability, OnePoint can host your websites on multiple servers in separate locations that are controlled by a load balancer. In the rare event of a problem, or a server being taken down for maintenance, the other servers will automatically pick up the requests. In addition to no downtime, it has the added benefit of providing a very fast and responsive user experience for your customers.</p>

                    <h4>Shared hosting vs Private hosting</h4>

                    <p>Sharing is caring, except when it comes to the last slice of pizza. Then it’s mine. In the digital world, sharing is easy and comes with many benefits. For example, sharing a server with other people means that you all share the cost of that server, making your site cheaper to host. On the flip side, it also means that you are sharing the server resources with others. For some people, this is an acceptable trade-off. But if you have a site that will do lots of transactions, or even if you just want to be certain that your site has the full attention of the server and will not be impacted by anyone else, then you should consider a private server.</p>
