                    <p>The software will live in a smart cloud environment, and will be deployed on an elastic server. This means that the server will automatically scale its resources up or down depending on how many users are accessing the site. This is great for the user experience as it makes sure the site has plenty of power behind it at all times and eliminates any sluggishness for the users. The elastic service also caters for world-wide deployments and localisation. The service will know which country the user is in, and will automatically send that user to the closest server, keeping response times lightning fast. If required, the service can also provide a site in the user's local language, or using the local currency.</p>
