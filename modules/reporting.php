                    <p>The Reporting module is a completely customised solution provided to clients based on their reporting requirements. No cost are given at this stage as further details are usually required from the client. Most people choose to tag this on at the end of the project once other information and system set up is finalised as it can influence the content and output of the reports. Towards the end of the Analysis process is a good time to revisit this requirement.</p>
